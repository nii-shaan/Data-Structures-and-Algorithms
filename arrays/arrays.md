# What? 
- Collection of element which are of same data types
- is contigious in memory >> one after another
- Fixed in size/length
- Access time is constant for all element due to indexing

# Why?
- Do not need to track elements independently
- Efficient use of memory

# Examples:
- `int student1, student2, student3, student4, student5;` BAD
- `int[5];` is better
